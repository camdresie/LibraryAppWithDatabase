This project is a library application with a SQL database that allows users to add, remove, and edit books from a library database. The database is a SQLite database that is
accessed in the program using the Sequelize ORM for JavaScript. Sequelize validation is used to ensure that required values are passed to the forms when creating or updating 
books. This project uses an Express middleware to serve its pages. It also uses Pug templates to render its pages.
